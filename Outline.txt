Background on my work

Outline of talk

Why do we care about RNA at all?

Original picture:

  Crick, F. (1970). Central dogma of molecular biology. Nature.

Present day:

  Peptide bond catalysis
  Intron splicing
  Post-transcriptional gene regulation
    RNAi (Fire, A. Z. and Mello, C. C. received 2006 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine)
  Transcriptional and translational allosteric regulation via riboswitches
  Retranslation events (Selenocysteine insertion)
  Ribosomal frameshift

Motivation for folding pathways / RNA kinetics

  hok/sok

Why isn't it possible to exhaustively compute folding kinetics

  $s_n \sim 1.10437 \cdot 2.61803^n / n^{\frac{3}{2}}$

  from Stein and Waterman, 1979 indicates

Discussion of current approaches (and their limitations)

Two approaches:

  Explicit solution of master equation

    Treekin
    Hermes

  Simulations

    Kinfold
    KFOLD
    Kinefold

What I will show in the end

How to get there (story in 3 parts)
